##Coding Manual
### How to be a good Coder and Succeed in CS Environments
**This manual is intended to give a CSE knowledge that has been gathered by Castorcitos inc.**

* Understand what is:
  * DB: REL/NoSQL/Graph.
  * Complexity (Time/Space) and Why it is important.
* Do personal projects for whatever idea you have.
* Create a GIT HUB account and upload your code there.
* Create a Stack Overflow (SO) account and ask/response questions. Ask what specific details not ask for complete problem resolution.
* Practice as if your life depends on it.
* Create your Linkedin Profile.
* If you do not know something, learn it, IT interviews are not Hollywood castings where you need to say you know everything, here if you do not know something you do not know it, it is better to comment on what you actually know about that topic and not lie about your knowledge.
* The more you know about Computer Science the easier it will be to understand all the new/complex/interesting things out there, if you did not have the luck of having good Computer Science courses learn on your own.
* The best investment you can make is in your own knowledge, invest your time and money learning and updating on new technology.
* There will always be people that know less than you and earn more, and viceversa.
* Grab a Git Hub tutorial and learn the Git Bash commands, it is better than using the Application that is available to download.
* RTFM (Read the fucking manual).
* You need to read more code than the one you write.
